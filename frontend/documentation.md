# Total Recall Frontend Enhancement Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the enhancements made to the Total Recall frontend components. The goal was to create an intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of extracting their ChatGPT conversation history and injecting it into GPT's persistent memory.

## Project Structure

The enhanced frontend follows a structured organization:
