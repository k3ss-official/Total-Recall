# Total Recall Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the integration of the Total Recall application components. Total Recall is a tool that automatically extracts historical GPT conversations and injects them into GPT's persistent memory.

## Components Integrated

The following components have been successfully integrated:

1. **Frontend**: React-based user interface for interacting with the application
2. **API**: FastAPI backend that handles all server-side operations
3. **Framework**: Core functionality for conversation extraction and memory injection
4. **Deployment Automation**: Docker-based deployment configuration
5. **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite for all components

```

## Integration Process

### 1. Frontend-API Integration

The frontend has been integrated with the API through the following steps:

1. Created an API client (`frontend/src/lib/api.js`) that implements all necessary endpoints
2. Updated authentication context (`AuthContext.js`) to use real authentication endpoints
3. Modified login form to work with the new authentication system
4. Updated conversation context to fetch real conversation data
5. Enhanced processing context to use the processing API endpoints
6. Updated memory injection context to connect with memory injection endpoints

Key files modified:
- `frontend/src/lib/api.js` (new)
- `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js`
- `frontend/src/components/OpenAILoginForm.js`
- `frontend/src/context/ConversationContext.js`
- `frontend/src/context/ProcessingContext.js`
- `frontend/src/context/InjectionContext.js`

### 2. Deployment Automation

Deployment automation has been implemented with Docker:

1. Created a multi-stage Dockerfile that builds both frontend and API components
2. Set up a docker-compose.yml file that configures all necessary services
3. Created a deployment script that automates the entire deployment process
4. Added environment variables template for configuration

Key files created:
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `deploy.sh`
- `.env.example`

### 3. Testing Framework

A comprehensive testing framework has been implemented:

1. Created a Python test runner script that can run all test types
2. Implemented a shell script that runs tests and generates reports
3. Organized tests into unit, API, integration, and frontend categories

Key files created:
- `run_tests.py`
- `run_test_suite.sh`

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker (version 20.10.0 or later)
- Docker Compose (version 2.0.0 or later)
- Python 3.10 or later
- Node.js 16 or later
- npm or pnpm

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd total-recall
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

3. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

4. Access the application:
   - API: http://localhost:8000
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8000 (served by the API)

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
./run_test_suite.sh

# Run specific test types
python run_tests.py --unit
python run_tests.py --api
python run_tests.py --integration
python run_tests.py --frontend

# Run with verbose output
python run_tests.py --all --verbose
```

Test results will be saved in the `test_results` directory.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available at http://localhost:8000/api/docs when the application is running.

Key endpoints:

- Authentication: `/api/auth/*`
- Conversations: `/api/conversations/*`
- Processing: `/api/processing/*`
- Export: `/api/export/*`
- Memory Injection: `/api/injection/*`
- Direct Injection: `/api/direct-injection/*`
- WebSocket: `/api/ws/*`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker container fails to start**:
   - Check if ports are already in use
   - Verify Docker is running
   - Check logs with `docker-compose logs`

2. **API connection errors**:
   - Verify the API is running
   - Check network configuration
   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly

3. **Authentication failures**:
   - Verify OpenAI session token is valid
   - Check authentication configuration in .env file

### Logs

- API logs: Available in the Docker container logs
- Frontend logs: Check browser console
- Test logs: Available in the `test_results` directory

## Maintenance

### Updating Components

1. **Frontend**:
   - Update code in the `frontend` directory
   - Rebuild with `docker-compose build`

2. **API**:
   - Update code in the `api` directory
   - Rebuild with `docker-compose build`

3. **Configuration**:
   - Update environment variables in the `.env` file
   - Restart with `docker-compose restart`

### Backup and Recovery

Backup scripts are available in the `deployment` directory:
- `backup_db.sh`: Backs up the database
- `backup_volumes.sh`: Backs up Docker volumes
- `restore_db.sh`: Restores database from backup

## Conclusion

The Total Recall application has been successfully integrated with all components working together seamlessly. The application can now be deployed using the provided automation scripts and tested using the comprehensive testing framework.
